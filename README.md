# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh







......About Projec...................

a simple to-do list application that allows users to:

Add tasks: Users can type a task in the input field and click "ADD" to include it in their to-do list.
Mark tasks as completed: Clicking on a task toggles a "completed" status, visually represented by a strikethrough effect.
Delete tasks: Users can remove tasks by clicking a delete (cross) button.
Persist tasks: The app saves tasks in the browser's localStorage, ensuring the list remains intact even if the user refreshes the page or reopens the app later.
